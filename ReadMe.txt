<My Angry Birds Level Editor creates and adds objects to the game. You can change the background of the game in the level
editor and design your own level with the pre existing elements. This version of the level editor does not fully save and
connect to the server however this will be added in a future version>

## Synopsis
---------------
This version of my Level Editor does not post to the server, I did not have enough time to complete this feature so on the time I had left I focused on the UI and UX of the Level Editor.
If more time was given for the Level Editor I would connect it to the PHP server and make add a clone function to clone each object when they are dragged from the parent object in order to create
new child objects. I would also improve the overall functionality of the Level Editor.


## Motivation
---------------
I designed the level editor for ease of use, to me designing the UI and UX was the most important part of the project and I focused on this heavily as I want the user to have a good experince.
The design follows google material design guidelines and creates a simple and beautiful level editor layout.
